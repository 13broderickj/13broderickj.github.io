# The start of our journey
It was the end of freshmen year and as I was about to leave the dorm someone purposed a project that would be cool to do. 
The project was this, at the end of the semester every class offered has a course evaluation, 
all the course evaluations are posted online for everybody to see. What if somebody did some sort of statistical analysis on those courses. 
Being the huge nerd that I am I leaped at the opportunity to do more work over the summer,
this is the journey that I have taken gathering the data, and doing some looking at the data. I would like to express now that this is an opinion. 
Obviously everybody has their own strengths and weakness, all this article is doing is providing evidence to what may be the harder departments at my school. 

## Gathering The Data

The first thing that has to be done in order to create a statistical analysis is to obviously gather data. There were a couple things to consider when choosing the data. 
One is that there is a difference between the reviews done previously in 2007. Up until 2007 all reviews were done in paper and mandatory, afterwards they were all done online. 
While going paperless is admirable, it also is not surprising that a bunch of college kids stopped doing reviews and focused on more important things, like complaining about how hard classes are. 
So I had to decide whether or not I wanted to deal with incomplete data in 2007 and forward. On the one hand this data is up to date and current,
however seeing as how some classes that might have 100 kids in them and only 20 will respond is not a very good representation as to what everybody thought of the classwork. 
So in order to make my claims more substantial, I decided to go with data before 2007.

I am only human. 

So then quickly gathering the data from 1998 to 2006 in some text documents, I made a string parser and went on to decide what I should study. 
Next is to decide on as to what departments to focus on. Surprisingly enough some departments change and are getting rid of over time. 
Also some departments have less than 20 kids(Sorry Women Studies, Business Law, Arabic ) taking classes in them, surprise this creates really sporadic reviews. 
I decided to focus on departments that were here from 1998 to 2006, and had more than 200 kids taking classes with them. 
This left me a list of 11 departments: Economics; Chemistry; Biomedical Engineering( Surprise!);Math; English(Obviously); Engineering( the general courses);
Biology; Sociology; Psychology; History; and Physics. Congratulations to the winners!  Now lets look at the results. 

### The Graphs

The graph of the average workload of all the departments per semester( scroll over to see the which lines belongs to which department:

A couple interesting points to notice, one ECON and PSCL(Economics and Psychology) have one of consistently lowest workloads so you should probably take your social science elective from one of those deparments. 
Two SOCI(Sociology) has a steep drop in between Fall of 2003 to the Spring of 2005. Three big surprise physics and engineering are seen to be the hardest departments. This might be hard to see with the current graph, 
so I put the average of all the workloads every semester and plotted it to help see the trends more clearly.

If you don't see what is going on, it's okay I will break it down. The black line is the average of all the points, and the dotted yellow line is the standard deviation. 
There are only 4 departments that are outside of the standard deviation, which would be expected since around 67% of the data points are expected to fall within the deviation, and 7/11 points are. 
Physics and engineering are actually outside the deviation, indicating they have a heavier workload then the other departments, and psychology and economics are below the deviation
indicating they are a lot easier. I would like to point out that workload is not indicative of smartness. In fact if anything econ majors are probably the smartest people in college. 
While they work less than their physics counterparts they still get a <a href="http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report-2014/majors-that-pay-you-back"> similar salary</a>. 
Also not all economics classes are easier than all physics classes. Finding the standard deviation of every semester workload one can see that sometimes surprise economics overlaps with physics!
